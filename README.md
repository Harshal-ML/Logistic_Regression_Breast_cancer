# Logistic_Regression_Breast_cancer
Machine Learning based logistic regression classifier
Data-set obtained from UCI machine learning repository link- (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29). 
Data preprocessing required with imputation of mean value for missing values. 
Logistic regression model was created using Sci-kit learn library of python. 
The model predicts whether the tumor detected in a new client is benign or malignant. 
The models shows very high K-fold accuracy of 96% with standard deviation of 2.5. 
Confusion matrix for the predictions is also shown.
